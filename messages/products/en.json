	"product_sany_30_full_description": "Higher flow rate provides higher efficiency, such as faster rope winding speed. Shunt mode of independently controlled combined movements provides higher stability, such as simultaneous vibration-free lowering and lifting of loads.\n\nElectro-hydraulic control system ensures efficient flow distribution, quick response to combined movements and low impact, energy-saving and environmentally friendly. Precise control: Excellent jog mode performance, min. stable single rope speed 1.2 m/min and min. stable slewing speed 0.1°/s, ensuring precise mm-level lifting. Built-in slewing buffer control: booster buffer, sequential braking and free-run technology. Smooth start and stop.\n\nInnovative structural frame, tested for 200,000 fatigue cycles, ensures high reliability.\n\nCAN Bus System:\nControllers, displays, counters, I/O modules, sensors etc. are integrated into CAN bus network and respond quickly.\nFault Diagnosis System:\nWorking device with intelligent controller, body with BCM module accurately identifying fault location, making maintenance convenient.\nSANY load moment indicator system provides protection against overload, over-release, over-winding.\n\nSimple wiring and stable signal transmission. Automatic real-time monitoring of operating conditions.",
